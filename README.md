## What  is This?

Are you tired of typing a whole novel in English only to realize you're on the Arabic layout? This extension is your new best friend! It swaps your text back from the wrong keyboard layout to the right one like magic. But remember, it's only for **Arabic** and **English** lovers, sorry not sorry.

### Installation
1. **Download**: Get the zip from [here](https://github.com/MahmoudAdelbghany/keyboardlayoutfixer/releases/download/V1.0.0/keyboardlayoutfixer@mahmoud.a.rageh@gmail.com.shell-extension.zip).

### Usage
- **Default Shortcut**: The default shortcut to activate the layout fix is `Super (Win key) + K`. 
- **Adjust Shortcut**: You can change this in the GNOME Extensions app .

## TODO 
- **Clean Up the Code**: Right now, it's more spaghetti than my nonna's kitchen. It's my first thing with JS, so if you see it, don't laugh too hard. (Code was done in 2 hours, okay?)
- **More Languages**: If anyone other than me ever sees this repo and you're not Arabic or English, sorry, your language isn't on the VIP list yet. But hey, if you use it, maybe we'll add more.
- **Punctuation Check**: Currently, it doesn't tell if it's real punctuation or just mistyped and needs replacement. We need to teach this extension the difference between a purposeful period and a stray dot.

## Known Bugs 
- Subtitles in settings  doesnâ€™t update  after a new shortcut.
